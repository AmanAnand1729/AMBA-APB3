# AMBA-APB3
RTL design for AMBA APB3 bus in Verilog with configurable master, multiple slaves, and testbench.

# AMBA APB3 Bus â€” Verilog Implementation

This repository provides a simple and clear Verilog implementation of the **AMBA APB3 (Advanced Peripheral Bus version 3)** protocol.  
It includes a basic APB3 master, multiple slaves with address decoding, byte strobes, protection control, and a self-checking testbench.
